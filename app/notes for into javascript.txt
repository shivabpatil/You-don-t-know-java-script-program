type => values have type not variables.
type => Number, String, Boolean, null/undefined, Object, Symbol.
typeof null => it returns as object that is bug in JS. But lot of code is
               created around it so fixing it will create more bugs hence it
               not fixed.
object => can be accessed with . notation or obj["a"] index notation.
          Index notation used when property name has special character.
          Index notation needs string literal obj["a"] or variable
          obj[b] where b = "a".
array => this is special type of object. As it is an object it has properties
         and functions. Some of the properties are update automatically like length.

function => this is subtype of object. when used typeof on function it will return
            object.
boxing => string value is wrapped in String object and so on. This is known as
          boxing.
truthy /falsy => non boolean values that are coerced to false are :
                  "",NaN,0,-0,null,undefined,false
                 values that are not falsy are coerced to true like:
                 [],{} are considered true
