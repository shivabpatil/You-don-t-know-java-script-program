a = b * 2 => 2 is a literal value. Values that are included directly in
             the source code are called literals.
coercion  => changing the type of the variable.

string    => black in chrome and red in mozilla
number    => blue in chrome and  blue in mozilla
"99.99" == 99.99 => gives true as explicit coercion occur.

"You should strive not just to write programs that work correctly,
but programs that make sense when examined."

dynamic typing => the type of the variable decided at run time.
                  same variable can hold different type of values.

static typing/enforcement type => variable holds specific value. Prevents
                                  unintended coercions.

state(for program) => tracking the changes to values as program runs.

const => used to declare constant in javascripts. name of constant must be
        in capital with underscore. e.g TAX_RATE . can not change value.
        gives invalid assignment error.

conditional statements => implicit coercion occur in conditional statement to
                          get boolean value.
