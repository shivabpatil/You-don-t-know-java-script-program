Dear Daniel,

If you'd like to improve your English, one thing you can do is to build up your vocabulary. In order to do this, you have to practice a lot. Iâ€™m afraid there is not a short cut for this. But there are many effective ways. First of all, you should read a lot. You can read short stories, comics, newspapers, magazines etc. depending on your English level. As you read, you can try to guess the meanings of unknown words from the context of the sentence. If you cannot, then look up the definition in a dictionary. English to English dictionary should be your first choice and keep the translator as last.

Another way of building vocabulary is to watch movies in English which will also help with pronunciation. Try to be involved with the language as much as you can. Keep a vocabulary notebook and write down a few words each day. Keep in mind that you have to revise them regularly. In my opinion, to communicate with people all you need is words. Even if you just say the words one after another, people most likely will understand what you mean regardless of the order of the words and grammar.
